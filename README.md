Our analysis shows us that millions of people use the bike sharing program in NYC. The majority of users are males who seem to use it as a means to get to and from work on weekdays. Users also seem to use the bikesharing program on weekends. We can assume those using the bikesharing program on weekends are using it to enjoy their days off.


Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
