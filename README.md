Our analysis shows us that millions of people use the bike sharing program in NYC. The majority of users are males who seem to use it as a means to get to and from work on weekdays. Users also seem to use the bikesharing program on weekends. We can assume those using the bikesharing program on weekends are using it to enjoy their days off. Also the majority of people use the bikes for periods of about 5 minutes, meaning many clients can use the bikes one after the other in a quick rate!

## Summary
The citibike program is a viable program to start up in Des Moines. It has been very successful in NYC with millions of users and subscribers. It should also be a viable program for people to use in Des Moines. A lot of people will gravitate toward it at first for being new, but will stay on after making it part of their routine, both on weekdays and weekends.
